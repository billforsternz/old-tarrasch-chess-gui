The Tarrasch Chess GUI V2. No longer work in progress, but a working useful
chess program.  New Tarrasch development is occurring in peer repository
tarrasch-chess-gui

## Build Notes

Rebuilding Tarrasch from the source code delivery package is not rocket 
science, but it probably will take some application and patience, even 
from experienced developers.

At the time of this writing (26/03/2013), I have used Microsoft Visual Studio
2013 as my C++ compiler and linker. The build package includes solution and
project files generated by that version of Visual Studio.

It is also necessary to separately download, install and configure the 
open source WxWidgets GUI library.

I have been using v3.0.0 of this library. It's installed in the default
`C:\wxWidgets-3.0.0` location. I haven't checked for more recent versions of
WxWidgets. I don't expect problems if you do use a more recent version but I
can't dismiss the possibility out of hand.

In the Tarrasch property pages, the configuration properties explicitly 
call out specific WxWidgets directories in the Include and Library 
directories parts of each of the C/C++, the linker and resources 
sections.

If you use a different version of Visual Studio or WxWidgets and you 
find that gives you problems, I suggest the following two part strategy;

1. Put aside the Tarrasch source code for a while and concentrate on building
simple WxWidgets samples and demos. That process should be very well supported,
and there is no chance you can build Tarrasch if you can't get that far at
least.

2. Once you have confidence in your compiler + WxWidgets development
environment, take a suitable demo and start introducing the Tarrasch source
files. That basically mirrors the process that spawned Tarrasch in the first
place. You should quickly be able to add all the existing source files and
effectively you've grown a new Tarrasch solution. The only source files in the
package that aren't part of the Tarrasch GUI are ToyEngine.cpp which is the
root file in a separate console mode app (the toy engine) and
BuildLookupTables.cpp which is the sole file of a separate console mode
application to build GeneratedLookupTables.inc (which is included in the
package, you don't need to build it yourself).

## VERY IMPORTANT!

There is one really painful detail that you must get on top of. I have changed
the `Configuration Properties / C/C++ / Code Generation / Runtime Library`
field from its default Multi-threaded DLL to Multi-threaded. The reason is that
otherwise you don't get a fully static link. You want a real static link or
your version of Tarrasch might fail on a PC with different DLL versions to
yours. The catch is that *you must make the same change in the wxWidgets
libraries configuration and recompile those too*. If you don't you get annoying
and otherwise inexplicable link errors. See my question on the programmers site
stackoverflow.com for a little more background (search for my name).

The way I build wxWidgets is from the Visual Studio Native Tools command
prompt: `nmake /f makefile.vc RUNTIME_LIBS=static` will build the debug
version. Add `BUILD=release` for the release version.

## A note about the icon

My (admittedly primitive and rather pathetic) method of getting Pawel Koziol's
icon to replace the standard wxWidget icon was to replace each of `std.ico`,
`child.ico`, `mdi.ico` in directory `C:\wxWidgets-3.0.0\include\wx\msw` with a
copy of tarrasch.ico as included in this repository. I can't remember much
about this process, but no doubt I tried to do it in more rational ways without
success.

The main problem with this (apart from the patheticness and primitiveness
already alluded too) is that this tends to give every wxWidget app
you subsequently create this inappropriate icon. No doubt a much
better solution is possible.

Finally, I remember that Windows was reluctant to give up on using the
standard wxWidgets icon for Tarrasch, it seemed to be cached deep in
the OS somewhere, and would come back in vampire like fashion, at least
for a while.
